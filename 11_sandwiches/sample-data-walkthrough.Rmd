In the puzzle, we're given some sample data to use as a _test case_. That is, if we can determine the most popular sandwich in our sample, we'll be most--if not all--of the way to answering this question for our full dataset.

```{r warning = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
sw <- tibble::tribble(
          ~names, ~sandwiches,
          "Abby", "Denver; BLT; Torta ahogada; Barbecue",
       "Abigail", "BLT; Ftira; Primanti; Ice cream; Choripán",
          "Adam", "Corned beef; Montadito; Cheesesteak; Tripleta; Dagwood; Jambon-beurre",
         "Alexa", "Dagwood; Mortadella",
    "Alexandria", "Slider; Beschuit met muisjes; Chicken salad",
           "Ana", "Fried brain; Polish boy; Vegetable; Pudgy Pie; Dagwood"
    )

sw %>% knitr::kable()
```

Let's take a look at the sample data in tibble-mode. Note that there are a few non-English letters that could give you some trouble depending on how you import the data into R. Sometimes the letters get "translated" into a mix of letters and punctuation (i.e. "ChoripÃ¡n" rather than "Choripán").

```{r}
sw
```

As first step, let's separate out the sandwiches into individual observations using the handy `tidyr` function, `separate_rows()`. 

```{r}
sw %>% 
    separate_rows(sandwiches, sep = "; ") 
```

Keep in mind that omitting the space in the separator may cause some of the results not to match up. For example, "BLT" and " BLT" would require an extra cleaning step, such as `mutate(sandwiches = str_trim(sandwiches))`.

Next, we can count the sandwiches to determine which type is the most popular. Adding `sort = TRUE` brings the most popular sandwich to the top of the tibble.

```{r}
sw %>% 
    separate_rows(sandwiches, sep = "; ") %>% 
    count(sandwiches, sort = TRUE)
```

That's it! With this small sample, you've got the basics of a working wrangling script that you can try out on the full data.

Of the many coding puzzles on the web, few focus on the programming
skills needed for handling untidy data. During my summer internship at
RStudio, I worked with Jenny Bryan to develop a series of data science
puzzles known as the "Tidies of March." These puzzles isolate data
wrangling tasks into bite-sized pieces to nurture core data science
skills such as importing, reshaping, and summarizing data. We also
provide access to puzzles and puzzle data directly in R through an
accompanying Tidies of March package. I will show how this package
models best practices for both data wrangling and project management.

Packages mentioned in my talk:

-   [usethis](https://usethis.r-lib.org/) - a workflow package: it
    automates repetitive tasks that arise during project setup and
    development, both for R packages and non-package projects
-   [testthat](https://testthat.r-lib.org/) - to make testing fun
-   [testrmd](https://github.com/ropenscilabs/testrmd) - test chunks for
    RMarkdown
-   [reprex](https://reprex.tidyverse.org/) - render bits of R code for
    sharing, e.g., on GitHub or StackOverflow
-   [rmarkdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) - create reproducible
    text and analyses

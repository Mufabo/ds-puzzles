Teaching data science with puzzles
==================================

### rstudio::conf 2019, [slides](https://speakerdeck.com/isteves/teaching-data-science-with-puzzles)

Of the many coding puzzles on the web, few focus on the programming
skills needed for handling untidy data. During my summer internship at
RStudio, I worked with Jenny Bryan to develop a series of data science
puzzles known as the “Tidies of March.” These puzzles isolate data
wrangling tasks into bite-sized pieces to nurture core data science
skills such as importing, reshaping, and summarizing data. We also
provide access to puzzles and puzzle data directly in R through an
accompanying Tidies of March package. I will show how this package
models best practices for both data wrangling and project management.
